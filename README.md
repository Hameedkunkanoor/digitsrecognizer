# Digitsrecognizer
A python based machine learning application which predicts the digits based on the gestures shown in front of camera

This is a python based machine learning application in which I used Python openCV and various machine learning libraries for recognizing the gestures shown with a blue cap.This application contains three models which predict the gestures you have drawn using the cap in front of screen.

 Prerequisites: 
  1. opencv 3.4.1 
  2. Keras
  3. Tensorflow
  4. Numpy
  
 Execution:
  1. First Run the file firstmodel.py using command
    >python firstmodel.py
  2. First Run the file secondmodel.py using command
    >python secondmodel.py
  3. First Run the file thirdmodel.py using command
    >python thirdmodel.py
    
 Once you execute the above files you will get three models saved with names firstmodel.h5,secondmodel.h5,thirdmodel.h5.
 
  4.Execute the recognizer.py
    After executing this file you will see a window
